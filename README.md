## Debug-Mode
Use gradlew ```bootrun --debug-jvm``` to start Spring Bootrun in Debug-Mode. Spring will log the debug port to connect with. 

## Setup your Testdatabase
First set the Dev-Profile in application.properties active by chaing the following property
```
spring.profiles.active=dev
```
We use MariaDB as Production-Database. Install MariaDB locally on your Computer (https://mariadb.org/). When you are done open the database terminal, login and create a Databsae with
```
mysql -u root -p //-p only if you set a password
create database db_cookbook;
```
We use Flyway to setup the Tables, Contraints and Content of the database.
The Database Migration will run automatically on startup of the Springboot Application or manually with
```
gradlew flywayMigrate
```
Use ```gradlew flywayMigrate``` to cleanup your Testdatabase
